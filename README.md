## Logs & Metrics

Pulsar has carefully designed the logging and metrics subsystem to record every event that occurs in the system.

Pulsar logs the status for every load execution, so it's easy to know what happened in the system, find out answers such as is the system running healthy, how many pages were successfully fetched, how many pages were retried, how many proxy ips were used, etc.

Typical page loading logs are as the following, check [log-format](https://github.com/platonai/pulsarr/blob/master/docs/log-format.adoc) to learn how to read the logs to learn the status of the whole system at a glance.
